  Yuri - There are two accounts, 'willymcallister' is my main github presence,
  with the web site contents and circuit simulator. The 'bot account is
  separate. It has no content, it represents a github identity used by my
  Staticman instance running at Heroku. Staticman at Heroku receives the comment
  submission from you, formats it, and comes back into github using the 'bot's
  identity/password. The 'bot is an approved contributor to the regular
  willymcallister github account. The 'bot submits the comment file as a Pull
  Request to the Spinning Numbers repository (willymcallister.github.io). When I
  accept the PR it triggers a site rebuild and the comment magically appears on
  the otherwise static site.
