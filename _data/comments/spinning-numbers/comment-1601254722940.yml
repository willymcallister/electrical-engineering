  Derek - I don't have any worked examples yet for AC analysis. When you work
  with and AC circuit you are looking at frequency response and phase shift
  using the language of filters and transforms. The complex exponentials from
  Euler's Identity are embedded in things like the definition of the Fourier
  Transform. One related spot where we apply Euler's Identity to an important
  result is here:
