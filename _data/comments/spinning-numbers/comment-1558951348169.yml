  Breaking Benjamin is my favourite band of 2000s. Breaking Benjamin had so many
  hits! The ones I remember are 'The Diary of Jane', 'Tourniquet' and their hit
  'So Cold'. These are real masterpieces, not garbage like today! And it is sooo
  good that Breaking Benjamin have a tour in 2019! And I'm going to attend
  Breaking Benjamin concert in 2020. The concert setlist is here: <a

  Open the page and maybe we can even visit one of the performances together!
