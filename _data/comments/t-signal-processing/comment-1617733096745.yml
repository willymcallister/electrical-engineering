  Julia - I released this page a little earlier than expected. Signals is my
  next effort on Spinning Numbers. I'll start out in the time domain first,
  describing properties of sine waves and combinations of sines in picture form.
  It's a good thing to have in your head. That will be followed by the
  transition to frequency domain, where Bode Plots and filter theory is
  developed.
