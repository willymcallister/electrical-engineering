message: "Hello Willy!\r\nI'm a first year student in electrical engineering and your site has been a life saver! It has been very very helpful in explaining and clearing a lot of the concepts in an interesting way. I would like to ask in the Digital electronics section, there are a number of headings such as \"Bits as memory\" but they dont link to any article? Have they not been uploaded or are they just there to show what further topics can be studied??\r\nThankyou for this wonderful website, it is a life saver!\r\nRegards"
