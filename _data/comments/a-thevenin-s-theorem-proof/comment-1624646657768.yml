message: "Nick - I'm so glad this proof hit home for you. Grant Sanderson (3Blue1Brown) and I sat elbow-to-elbow at Khan Academy as content Fellows in 2016. We and the rest of our content-creation group had long discussions about how to best convey complex topics with specific-example-first then generalization. It seems to work. \r\n\r\nBy far the simplest way to prove Norton is to transform the Thevenin equivalent. I suppose it would be possible to go back to the start and change the goal from finding v = VT - Ri to finding i = IN - v/RN. (Be careful here, in the Thevenin proof I used the N subscript to count the current sources inside the black box; it does not represent the Norton equivalent current source. Probably should have used a different letter.) Since all good engineers are lazy, doing the source transformation is the preferred route."
