message: "Dear Mr McAllister,\r\n\r\nI came across your tutorials on AC circuit analysis and impedance analysis recently. I have finished listening to your tutorials and found them to be very helpful and insightful.\r\n\r\nI would like to ask for your permission to reproduce some figures (three figures and one table) on Euler transformation and impedance analysis in my thesis. These figures will be credited to you and the spinningnumbers.org following the copyright guidelines. Can you give me the permissions to reproduce these figures in my thesis? \r\n\r\nThank you and kind regards,\r\nMC"
