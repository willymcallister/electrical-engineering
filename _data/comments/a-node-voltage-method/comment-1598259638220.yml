message: "Hi!\r\n\r\nI'm just here to say thank you SO MUCH for this top-quality, well-written article on the Node Voltage Method!! I'm a first year Engineering student and have really been struggling to understand how to use this Method, and all the nuanced steps like, deciding current direction etc. hasn't been touched on in any of our lecture notes or textbooks the way you discuss it!! I've shared you website with my Group hoping others can also benefit from your content!! So once again, thank you so much!!"
