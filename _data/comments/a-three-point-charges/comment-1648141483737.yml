message: "If you change q2 to a positive charge then it is pushing on q0. That flips the direction of the force arrow F20 in the diagram in the Charge Triangle section. (https://spinningnumbers.org/a/three-point-charges.html#charge-triangle). Same magnitude, opposite direction.\r\n\r\nThis gives you a new force triangle to solve. Use the Laws of Cosines and Sines."
