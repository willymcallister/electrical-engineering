  The two opamp models are 'ideal" and a more recent addition, "realistic". The
  ideal model is used in exercises. It may be replaced over time. The realistic
  model has exposed power pins you have to connect yourself, which is just what
  you would have if you retrieve SPICE models from opamp manufacturers. Yes, the
  schematic is a little more involved, but that's how it's done in the real
  world. You can connect the power pins two ways: by wires to DC sources or
  connect via wire labels with the same name. Your choice.
