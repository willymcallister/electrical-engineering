message: "I made simple Op amp circuit, and when I click DC analysis I get: Newton method failed. Here is the circuit:\r\nPositive of Op Amp is connected to positive of 1V DC. Negative of DC voltage is connected to GND.\r\nNegative of Op amp connects to R1=1K, then other side of R1 connects to GND. \r\nThe negative of Op Amp also connects to Rf=1K which connects to output of Op Amp.\r\nI expect Op Amp output = 2V.\r\nI advise to fix this bug."
