  Khan Academy is outstanding for preparing for "big math tests". Aren't they
  all big? Look in the math subjects for your grade level or math subject
  (pre-algebra, algebra, etc.) There's a Course Challenge test that will guide
  you right to where you should start. If you have specific topics you want to
  hit, enter that in the Search box.
