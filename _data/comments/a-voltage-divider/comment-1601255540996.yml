  Nathanael - A voltage divider is used when you need a voltage in your circuit
  that isn't already supplied by a power supply or battery. If you have a
  circuit powered by a 9 volt battery and you need 1.5 volts for some reason. It
  is usually much cheaper to design a voltage divider with two resistors
  compared to buying a 1.5 volt battery. Resistors cost pennies, but a battery
  costs a dollar.
