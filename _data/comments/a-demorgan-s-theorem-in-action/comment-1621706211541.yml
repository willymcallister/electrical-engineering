  Gadgets - There is no simple way to implement a 4I OR function with NANDs. If
  you limit yourself to just 2I NAND gates you create three OR functions and
  combine them to get a 4I OR. Each OR function is three NAND gates. Two are
  configured as inverters for the inputs. The output of the two inverters are
  combined with a third NAND. If you draw that NAND with its DeMorgan "or"
  symbol you can more easily see the overall OR function.
