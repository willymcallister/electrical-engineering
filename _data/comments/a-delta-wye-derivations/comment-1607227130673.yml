  Rahmat - Good question, and I appreciate your skepticism. I will respond by
  revising the article with more appreciation of the linearity/superposition
  reasoning. It will take me another week or so to edit, create circuit
  diagrams, and publish. The goal is find out the resistor relationships so that
  from the outside you can't tell if the network is a Delta or a Wye. The
  equivalent resistance measured between any two nodes has to be the same. I can
  measure the resistance by creating an arbitrary surrounding circuit that
  applies V's and I's to the terminals and measure the ratio V/I = R_equiv. I
  will add three voltage sources connected to each terminal. THAT circuit with
  multiple sources can be analyzed by the Superposition Method you learned
  earlier. Hang on a week and I'll show you what all this means.
