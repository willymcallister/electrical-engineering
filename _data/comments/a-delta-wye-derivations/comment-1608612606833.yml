  I'm so glad the revised article was clear. The superposition argument is
  applied in a nearly identical way in the proof of Thevenin's Theorem. It took
  me a fair amount of fiddling to come up with the two external circuits
  (current sources for one, voltage sources for the other). Suppressing the
  extra two sources has to give you just the right open or short behavior. If
  you come up with an alternative I would be interested to know what you did.
  Thanks for the feedback on the "in series" symbol. The one I picked looks a
  bit like a minus sign. You may see that change if I find a better symbol.
  There is no standard "in series with" symbol like there is for || "in parallel
  with".
