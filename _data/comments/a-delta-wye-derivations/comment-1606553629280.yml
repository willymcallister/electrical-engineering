  Hi Will, Thank you for your derivation, it does help me a lot to understand
  these transformations. However, I still have some curiosity (or skepticism)
  regarding superposition argument that being used here. All derivation methods
  above developed from the step of equating resistance between nodes (Rxy, Rxz,
  Ryz) of 2 configurations (Y-delta). How exactly you use superposition
  principle to justify that? For reference, I already read your article about
  superposition, linearity, and its application on simple circuit i.e. How to
  decompose problem with more than one source, switching off voltage/current
  source, etc. I just can't make connection between those simple example to this
  transformation. Would you kindle explain that to me? Thank you in advance.
