  The law of superposition allows Coulomb's law to be extended to include any
  number of point charges. The force acting on a point charge due to a system of
  point charges is simply the vector addition of the individual forces acting
  alone on that point charge due to each one of the charges. The resulting force
  vector is parallel to the electric field vector at that point, with that point
  charge removed.
