  Dixon - The diagram inside the "show answer" for Problem 3 is intentionally
  different than the diagram in the problem statement. The two diagrams are
  equivalent, but in the case of the "show answer" diagram, all the arrows are
  arranged to point _out_ of the node. Notice two arrows changed direction and
  their corresponding current values changed sign. The purpose of doing this
  arrow-flipping stunt is to help you get all the signs in the KCL equation
  correct. If you are comfortable writing KCL based on the first diagram by all
  means you should do it that way.
