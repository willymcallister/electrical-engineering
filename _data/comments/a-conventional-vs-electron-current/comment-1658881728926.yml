  George - The military made a well-intentioned effort to teach electronics
  based on electron current. They wanted to avoid the puzzlement we inflict on
  new students when we tell them about "conventional" current. Alas, that
  attempt to "solve" the current direction "problem" did not get much farther
  than military training classes. The rest of the EE world stuck with the
  convention of tracking positive charge movement. That attempt left in its wake
  a lot of military electrical technicians who were even more confused when
  they  came across teaching resources like Spinning Numbers and university
  textbooks.
