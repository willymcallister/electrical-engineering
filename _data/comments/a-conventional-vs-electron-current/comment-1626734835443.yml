  The current convention for indicating direction is simply a quirky way we have
  decided to indicate which way electrons are going. There is no sense of
  "should" involved. The convention for pointing the current arrow is to point
  it in the direction the electrons are coming *from*. It's kind of like how a
  weather vane points in the direction the wind is coming *from*.
